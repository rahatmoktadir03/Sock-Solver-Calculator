# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Rahat Moktadir**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Animal Sock Calculator** is an Android app that calculates the number of socks needed to keep all animals in a zoo warm based on how many insects, big cats, and birds the user inputs. It also estimates the total cost of socks based on the number of legs.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üêæüß¶üßÆ

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] At least one (1) user input
- [x] At least one (1) interactive View
- [x] At least one (1) output of a calculation based on the user input

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Implement ViewBinding to reduce boilerplate code and increase efficiency
- [x] Add at least one (1) additional functionality  
  (üí° Calculated total **sock cost** using price-per-sock logic)

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Default inputs to 0 if user leaves any field blank
- [x] Clear, multi-line result formatting with total legs and cost breakdown
- [x] Input validation using `toIntOrNull()` for crash prevention

## Video Demo

## Notes

I had a blast working on this project ‚Äî this was my first time converting a Jetpack Compose starter project to use traditional XML layouts and ViewBinding. I ran into some theme compatibility issues (Theme.AppCompat vs. Material3) but learned how to properly update `themes.xml` to support AppCompat widgets. That experience really helped me understand how the Android view system and theming works under the hood.
